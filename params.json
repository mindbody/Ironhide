Ironhide provides an easier to use framework by handling some of the more complex elements of Espresso and Hamcrest matchers in the background, and providing the user with an easy way to create tests. A basic understanding of Googleâ€™s Espresso is recommended.\r\n\r\n# How does it work?\r\nIronhide is composed of Models and Page Elements.  Models represent the various pages in your application. These Models are in turn populated by Page Elements that represent the various views and elements on the page. A test built with Ironhide will give the starting model and then chain together actions or assertions taken on page elements.  Because of the nature of Ironhide, almost all tests can be made in one chain of actions, which results in tests being written much like they might be spoken. Here is an example of what a simple test might look like:\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testgetToAddClientActivity(){\r\n  \tSchedulePage\r\n\t\t.NavDrawerButtonIcon.pause()\r\n\t\t.NavDrawerButton.click()\r\n\t\t.ClientsButton.click()\r\n\t\t.SearchClientField.pause()\r\n\t\t.AddClientButton.click()\r\n\t\t.FirstNameField.isDisplayed()\r\n\t\t.LastNameField.isDisplayed()\r\n\t  ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis test does the following:\r\n* Starts on the SchedulePage\r\n* Pauses to allow the page to load.\r\n* Clicks on the Navigation Drawer button to open the Navigation Drawer\r\n* Clicks on the Clients button in the navigation drawer.\r\n* Wait for the clients page to load (by pausing on the SearchClientField).\r\n* Click on the Add Client button.\r\n* Checks if the FirstNameField is displayed.\r\n* Checks if the LastNameField is displayed.\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n**Before getting started make sure to read the Espresso Set Up Instructions** [here](https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/wiki/EspressoSetupInstructions)\r\n\r\n1. Download the JAR file.\r\n2. Put the Ironhide JAR in the libs folder in your app.\r\n3. Add `androidTestCompile files('libs/Ironhide-1.X.X.jar')` in the dependencies section of your build.gradle file\r\n\r\n# More Information\r\n[Ironhide Wiki](https://github.com/mindbody/Ironhide/wiki)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2015 MINDBODY, Inc.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
